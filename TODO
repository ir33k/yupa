BUG	URI with tabs in history file

	When URI contain tabs then history file is broken.  This can
	easily happen with Gopher search links as with those the
	search phrase is separated from URI using tab.

TODO	URL in Gopher h menu item might lead to Gemini not HTTP

TODO	Handle whitespaces in Gemini URI

	From what I remember spaces and tabs should be replaces with
	%20 or something like that.

TODO	Improve history.gmi file

	Browsing history is very often used because without tabs it
	plays big role in navigation between recently open pages.  But
	it's cluttered and repeats the same entries often.  It would
	be beneficial to make it more user friendly.

	I have few things in mind:

	1. Divide history.gmi file into separate file per year.  That
	   way dates inside history log can be shorter and we will
	   load smaller file while still keeping entire browsing
	   history with files: history/2025.gmi, history/2024.gmi.

	2. Have second history only for given session that don't have
	   dates, only links that are in order of last visited without
	   duplication.

TODO	Add details to gemini links

	When navigating Gopher links it's easy to see what kind of link
	you are clicking on because type of resource is always printed.
	So I know that I'm going to open non Gopher link like image, or
	html before I choose that link without checking the full URI.
	In Gemini I don't have that.  I would like to add it for all
	non Gemini links.  So I'm not surprised that suddenly browser
	is open or video will be downloaded.

	Gemini protocol is designed like HTTP which means user don't
	know the contnet-type in advance.  It's defined by response.
	But in many cases link content can be predicted by the protocol
	or file extensions.
