Yupa is a CLI browser for Gopher, Gemini and HTTP[S] (beta) protocols.

Documentation is accessible inside Yupa in help pages that are open
with `h` command.  Pages describe topics like history, links, cache,
session, extensibility through custom binds, shell commands, env
variables and more.

Build and run:

	$ ./build       # Compile and run tests
	$ ./yupa -h     # Print usage instruction
	$ ./yupa URI    # Run with optional URI
	$ yupa> h       # Open help pages within Yupa

Usage:

	yupa> gemini://tilde.pink       # Load page

	# After page is loaded the YUPAPAGER (less by default) is used
	# to display it.  When you are done reading the page and you
	# want to insert another Yupa command you have to first quit
	# the pages.  In case of less it's done by pressing 'q'.

	yupa> i81       # Inspect page link
	yupa> 81        # Visit page link
	yupa> b         # Go back in undo history
	yupa> f         # Go forward in undo history
	yupa> q         # Quit

Yupa is a successor to gmi100 [1][2] which is a Gemini CLI browser
written in 100 lines of C.  Even tho gmi100 was just made for fun I
found it approach to browsing text protocols very appealing.  I kept
using gmi100 despite having "better" alternatives easily available.

This is how Yupa was born.  It's essentially the same interface with
same UX philosophy but with support for more protocols and features.
