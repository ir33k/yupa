Yupa, WORK IN PROGRESS

For v2.0 I want to have Gemini support.

- Gemini basic support (essentially what I have in gmi100).
- History list.
- Restoring previous browsing session.
- Better error handling as many of them will just kill program.

Test URIs:

gopher://tilde.pink
gopher://geminiprotocol.net
gopher://gopher.floodgap.com
gopher://hngopher.com:70/1/archive/2017/2017-07-17/items/14791355
