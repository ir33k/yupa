Yupa is a CLI browser for Gopher and Gemini protocols.

It's a successor to gmi100 [1][2] which was only made for fun but I
found it approach to browsing text protocols very appealing.  I kept
using gmi100 despite having "better" alternatives easily available.
This is how Yupa was born.  It's essentially the same interface but
for Gopher and Gemini protocols with more features.

Build and run:

	$ ./build       # Compile yupa binary
	$ ./yupa -h     # Print usage instruction
	$ ./yupa URI    # Run with optional URI
	$ ./yupa h      # Run with help command

Usage:

	$ ./yupa		# Start Yupa
	gemini://tilde.pink	# Load page with absolute URI

	# After page is loaded the YUPAPAGER (`less` by default) is
	# used to display it.  When you are done reading the page and
	# you want to insert another Yupa command you have to first
	# quit the pager.  In case of less it's done by inserting `q`.

	i81	# Inspect page link
	81	# Visit page link
	b	# Go back in browsing history
	f	# Go forward in browsing history
	h	# Print help message with list of commands
	q	# Quit
