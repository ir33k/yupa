Yupa, WORK IN PROGRESS

I'm activli working on it at the moment (2024.01.01 Mon 16:16) to have
v1.0 for my personal usage but you never know with thos side projects.
I hope it will be finished soon as I would like to use it.

MVP What I would like to have before calling this a v1.0?

x Executing shell commands.
x Downloading raw and formatted response.
x Gopher support for search item.
x Gopher support for error item.
x Gopher are there any other special items?

For v2.0 I want to have Gemini support.

- Gemini basic support (essentially what I have in gmi100).
- History list.
- Restoring previous brosing session.
- Better error handling as many of them will just kill program.

Test URIs:

gopher://tilde.pink
gopher://geminiprotocol.net
gopher://gopher.floodgap.com
gopher://hngopher.com:70/1/archive/2017/2017-07-17/items/14791355
