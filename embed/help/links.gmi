# Links

Each page link is prefixed with an index number.  To visit a link type that index to input prompt.  Use index as argument in info command `i` in order to see link before visiting it, e.g: `i6`, `i20`, `i 21`.

Links can be relative or absolute.  You can type path relative to current page instead of using link numbers.  For example `../` will go one directory up, `/` will navigate to root of current page.

By convention link with index of 0 is always an absolute URI to current page.  With that you can reload page by typing `0` or see current page URI with `i0`.  Thanks to cache, reloading will not cause another fetch.  Page will be loaded from local drive so `i0` is a good way to see page again using default pager.  Clear cache with `c` command to actually reload the page.
